1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
The differences between Client Side and Server side are pretty vast and different. Server side routing is what most web pages are based off and require the page to be reloaded whenever you switch pages or send a request. Client side routing loads the whole website up at the launch of the site and thus makes switching pages a lot quicker because the page doesn't need to be reloaded every time. The downside to client side rendering is that it is a lot harder to implement good SEO practices on the pages.
